Great! It sounds like you already have some experience with C and want to create desktop projects. Let me help you clarify and expand on your programming skills.

I noticed a few language points that might help:
- "I have experience with C"
- "I can create desktop projects"

Since you have C experience, let's discuss desktop application development in C. There are several approaches:

1. Console Applications
- Simple text-based programs
- Quick to develop
- Good for learning and utility tools

2. GUI Libraries for Desktop Applications
- GTK+ (cross-platform)
- Qt (professional cross-platform framework)
- Win32 API (for Windows-specific applications)

Example of a basic GTK+ application structure:
```c
```

Would you like to:
1. Discuss desktop application frameworks?
2. Share more about the type of desktop project you want to create?
3. Get tips on GUI programming in C?

Please tell me more about your specific interests and goals!
